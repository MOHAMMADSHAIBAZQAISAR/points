-> python doesnt need to declare datatype with its type name
jst assign the value to it and will get know wht type of value it has.
-> python has four type of data sturctures 
	1.list: we uses append() function to add data in the list.
	-> input function is used to take input from the user.
-> python uses def keyword to define a function...
def function-name(arguments):
            #function body

-> we can import many lib in python 
like math lib int that we uses fabs for absolute numbers..
-> import keyword
and print keyword.kwlist and it will print all keywords in the python lang..

-> None keyword is void or null not equals to 0 and any empty container... does not compute to null.
