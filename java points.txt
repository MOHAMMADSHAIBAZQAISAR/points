class doesnt use any memory when it is created,when we create object it use memory space.

we shouuld write code in dry(Don't Repeat Yourself) manner
in pass by value we pass the value not address changes doesn't effect on passed variable
in pass by refernce we don't pass the value we jst pass the address and changes also effect on the main variable.

And Java is always PASS BY VALUE;

when constructors are created with parameters than you can't create obj w/o para... ,for that you 
need to define a default constructor in the class.
